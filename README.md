# Classroom Capacity Determiner 
This project was developed as part of **ITSC 1212 - Introduction to Computer Science I** at the **University of North Carolina at Charlotte**. 
## Project Overview 
The program calculates classroom, floor, and total building capacity for **CCI's Woodward Hall** under varying state capacity mandates. 
## Features & Functionality 
- Calculates
  - Per-classroom: Normal and state-regulated capacity
  - Per-floor: Total normal and state-regulated capacity
  - Entire building: Number of floors and total state capacity
- Input from user:
  - State-regulated capacity percentage
  - Normal classroom capacity
  - Number of floors
  - Number of classrooms per floor
  - Capacity for each classroom
- Input Validation:
  - Rejects negative percentage values
  - Requires at least 1 floor
  - Requires at least 2 classrooms per floor
